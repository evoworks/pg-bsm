## PG-BSM

This is a repository for a fork of the code for **a novel approach called the phenotype–genotype branch-site model (PG-BSM)** designed to detect evidence of adaptive codon evolution associated with discrete-state phenotype evolution. The null model makes use of a covarion-like component to account for general heterotachy (*i.e.,* random changes in the evolutionary rate at a site over time). The alternative model employs samples of the phenotypic evolutionary history to test for phenomenological patterns of heterotachy consistent with specific mechanisms of molecular adaptation. 

The model is implemented in MatLab (by Chris Jones when working in the Bielawski Research Group) and this implementation is intended to serve as a proof of concept. We have plans to re-implement the model in C++ in another widely-used software package.

The paper describing the method is:
